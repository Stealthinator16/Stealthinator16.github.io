<b>This is Stealthinator16<b>

A weird username? Maybe. I got it when  I was a kid and used to read Wimpy Kid books. In the second book of the serious, Greg got a new nickname which was, yeah correct!, Stealthinator, for stealig clips of girls' change room. That was when I used a username for the first time and it stuck. 16 is the number which I believed to be lucky(not now) and has stuck too.

My real name is Kushagra Tiwari. I live in India. I am 15 on the day of writing (this is 2017). I am someone you'd call a jack of all trades and master of none. I have extremely varied interests and havn't yet decided what to do in life. I might end up being a software developer, a blogger, an author or work for IFS (Indian Foreign Service).

Currently, I work for O-MUN (Online Model United Nations) as Officer of Workshop and Ambassador to India. I have a facebook page with a friend (TheClashster, know him?); we make memes on photos from Model UN conferences. ALso, I'm an avid reader. I love thought provoking litreature. I love playing TANKI Online.

If you are still reading this then you deserve to know my most favourite activity, which is tweaking with software. I currently have 4 OS installed on my PC (Win10, MacOS, Ubuntu and ArchOS). I occasionaly port ROMs to my Android device and (still) love Xposed (call me old school?).
